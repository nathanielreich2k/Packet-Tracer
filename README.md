# Cisco Packet-Tracer Lab - Router/VLAN Configuration using the CLI   ðŸ’»ðŸ”Œ

## Objective
âœ¨ To construct and configure a basic network topology utilizing routers and VLANs in Cisco Packet Tracer, employing Command Line Interface (CLI) commands to implement VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN routing. The objective is to provide hands-on experience in creating a simple network infrastructure and understanding the fundamentals of network communication for small to medium-sized businesses.


### Skills Learned

- Ability to send ICMP packets to another device on the network.
- Understanding of LAN and the assignment of static and dynamic IP assignment. 
- Configuration of IP, subnet, and gateway addresses for endpoints.
- Ability to segment vlans for each department.


### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
